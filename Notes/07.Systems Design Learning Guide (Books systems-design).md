# Systems Design Learning Guide (Books/systems-design)

Assumption: you meant `Books/systems-design/`.

## Books You Have (Best Order)

1. `Software Engg.pdf`
2. `Designing Data-Intensive Applications - Martin Kleppmann.pdf` (DDIA)
3. `System Design Interview An Insider’s Guide by Alex Xu (z-lib.org).pdf`
4. `Rockstar-Developer-2025.pdf`

## Goal

Build practical system design skill: reason about tradeoffs, design under constraints, communicate clearly, and improve with feedback.

## 12-Week Plan

## Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundations

Primary book: `Software Engg.pdf`

- Study: requirements, architecture basics, quality attributes, testing, maintainability.
- Output each week:
  - 1 summary note (1 page)
  - 1 glossary note (20 terms)
  - 1 mini design doc for a small app (auth + CRUD)

## Phase 2 (Weeks 3-7): Deep Systems Thinking

Primary book: `Designing Data-Intensive Applications - Martin Kleppmann.pdf`

- Week 3: data models, storage engines, indexing
- Week 4: replication, partitioning
- Week 5: transactions, consistency, consensus
- Week 6: stream/batch processing
- Week 7: reliability and operations review

Weekly outputs:

- 1 “chapter -> real system” mapping (e.g., chat, ecommerce, analytics)
- 1 tradeoff table (latency, consistency, cost, complexity)
- 1 architecture diagram (start simple, then scale version)

## Phase 3 (Weeks 8-10): Interview-Oriented Application

Primary book: `System Design Interview An Insider’s Guide by Alex Xu (z-lib.org).pdf`

- Do 2 design problems per week in timed format.
- For each problem, follow the same structure:
  - Clarify requirements
  - Estimate scale
  - Define APIs
  - High-level design
  - Deep dive (DB/cache/queue/sharding)
  - Bottlenecks + improvements

Target: 6 full solutions by end of week 10.

## Phase 4 (Weeks 11-12): Engineering Maturity

Primary book: `Rockstar-Developer-2025.pdf`

- Focus: communication, ownership, execution habits.
- Convert your best 2 designs into:
  - design review presentation (5-10 min)
  - implementation roadmap (milestones, risks, observability)

## Weekly Schedule (Repeatable)

- Day 1-2: read and annotate
- Day 3: summarize and build glossary
- Day 4: design exercise
- Day 5: tradeoff review + revise
- Day 6: timed mock (45-60 min)
- Day 7: retrospective (what improved, what is weak)

## How to Read Efficiently

- Don’t read passively. Every chapter must produce an output artifact.
- Use the “3-question method” per chapter:
  - What problem does this solve?
  - What tradeoff does it introduce?
  - When should I avoid this approach?
- Keep a running “decision journal” with architecture decisions and rejected options.

## Practice Projects (Apply While Learning)

Build these in parallel (increasing complexity):

1. URL shortener
2. Notification service
3. Rate limiter service
4. Event-driven order pipeline

For each project, define:

- SLOs (availability, p95 latency)
- scale assumptions
- failure modes
- monitoring/alerting plan

## Mastery Checklist

You’re progressing well if you can:

- explain CAP and consistency tradeoffs with examples
- choose SQL vs NoSQL with explicit constraints
- design caching and invalidation strategy
- reason about partitioning and hot keys
- communicate bottlenecks and mitigation plan clearly

## Minimal Tooling for Notes

Create and maintain these notes in Vault:

- `Systems Design - Glossary`
- `Systems Design - Tradeoff Patterns`
- `Systems Design - Case Studies`
- `Systems Design - Mock Interview Log`

## Optional Compression Plan (If Busy)

If you only have 6 weeks:

1. DDIA core chapters (replication, partitioning, transactions)
2. Alex Xu interview framework and 4 mock designs
3. 1 end-to-end design writeup + review
