Here’s a **comparative snapshot of current consumer-grade CPU-integrated NPUs (Neural Processing Units)** — covering approximate performance (where available) and typical prices of systems featuring them. This focuses on the on-device NPU hardware you’d access via vendor-specific APIs (e.g., AMD Ryzen AI, Intel OpenVINO/AI Boost, Apple Core ML/Neural Engine, Qualcomm SNPE/Hexagon), not external accelerators.

## **1) NPU Performance Comparison (Peak TOPS & Practical Context)**

| Vendor / Platform                              | Typical NPU Peak (INT8 TOPS) | Notes on AI Performance                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 / X Elite (Windows)** | ~45 – 80 TOPS (latest)       | Qualcomm’s Hexagon NPU leads peak raw TOPS; Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme reported up to **80 TOPS** and high benchmark scores versus competitors. ([Windows Central][1])                                                                      |
| **AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series**                    | ~50 TOPS                     | AMD’s XDNA2 NPUs on Ryzen AI chips deliver ~50 TOPS on many models (including lower-end Ryzen AI 5) — competitive head-to-head with Snapdragon X Elite in pure TOPS. ([ernestchiang.com][2])                                                 |
| **Intel Core Ultra / AI Boost (Lunar Lake)**   | ~48 TOPS                     | Intel’s newer Lunar Lake NPUs are typically around ~48 TOPS, competitive with AMD but generally behind the highest Snapdragon X2 results. ([GEEKOM España][3])                                                                               |
| **Apple Silicon Neural Engine (e.g., M4)**     | ~38 TOPS                     | Apple’s Neural Engine in Apple Silicon (M-series) emphasizes efficiency and system-wide performance; its reported peak (~38 TOPS) is lower in pure TOPS but benefits from unified memory and software stacks (Core ML). ([GEEKOM España][3]) |

**Notes on Metrics:**
*TOPS (Tera Operations Per Second)* figures provide rough throughput estimates for low-precision workloads (e.g., INT8). They **don’t directly translate to real application performance** because efficiency, memory bandwidth, software stack support, and workload type matter a great deal. ([Forbes][4])

## **2) Price & Market Positioning (Consumer Devices)**

### **Apple (Neural Engine)**

* Apple Silicon Macs (e.g., MacBook Air/Pro with M-series chips) typically start around **~$999–$1,299** for base models and scale to **$2,000+** for higher-end Pro variants.
* While the Neural Engine isn’t sold standalone, Apple’s ecosystem and CoreML/CUDA alternatives provide good AI dev support for on-device tasks like inference.
* **Strength:** High efficiency and software ecosystem; **limitation:** closed ecosystem.
  (*Market pricing is based on typical Apple Silicon laptop pricing — MacBook Air/Pro lines — current for 2025–2026.*)

### **AMD Ryzen AI (Windows Copilot+ PCs)**

* Devices with Ryzen AI 5/7/9 variants present **wide pricing tiers**:
  — Entry Ryzen AI laptops (e.g., AMD Ryzen AI 5 340 models) around **~$499–$799**. ([Best Buy][5])
  — Mid-range Ryzen AI (Ryzen AI 7) around **~$699–$1,099**. ([Best Buy][5])
  — Premium configurations (Ryzen AI 9 with GPU) can exceed **$1,500–$2,400+**. ([Best Buy][5])
* **Strength:** Good price-to-performance with ~50 TOPS NPU; **weakness:** developer stack maturity varies by OS and support.

### **Intel Core Ultra (Windows Copilot+ PCs)**

* Intel Core Ultra laptops range from **mid-range ~$799** to high-end **~$1,300+** depending on model and configuration (RAM/SSD). ([TechRadar][6])
* NPU performance (~48 TOPS) positions Intel in the middle of the pack.

### **Qualcomm Snapdragon X / X2 (Windows on Arm)**

* Snapdragon X-equipped laptops (e.g., Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 with Snapdragon X Elite) mostly sit around **~$1,000-$1,600+** currently. ([Walmart.com][7])
* Lower-price Snapdragon X Plus systems have appeared around **~$799–$899** (older models). ([Smartprix][8])
* Upcoming Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme platforms with stronger NPU performance (~80 TOPS) are expected in devices, **likely pushing prices higher (often above $1,000)**. ([Windows Central][1])

## **3) Software / API Support Considerations**

| Vendor             | Primary AI API / SDK                                                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Apple**          | Core ML / Create ML                                                                |
| **Intel**          | OpenVINO / AI Boost (via Windows/DirectML)                                         |
| **AMD**            | ROCm / XDNA tooling (Windows Copilot+ integrations with ONNX, Microsoft AI Engine) |
| **Qualcomm**       | SNPE / Hexagon DSP APIs + Windows AI Engine                                        |
| **Cross-platform** | ONNX, TensorFlow Lite (varies by vendor NPU support)                               |

**Developer Reality:**
Having an NPU with high TOPS doesn’t **guarantee usable performance** for custom workloads unless the software stack provides low-level access and optimizations. Some consumer NPUs offer limited abstraction depending on OS and SDK maturity. ([Ars Technica][9])

---

## **Summary: Who Leads Where?**

* **Raw AI performance (NPU throughput):** Qualcomm’s **Snapdragon X2/X2 Elite Extreme** leads in peak TOPS among consumer CPU-integrated NPUs, with AMD Ryzen AI following closely. ([Windows Central][1])
* **Value (price-to-performance):** AMD Ryzen AI currently offers strong NPU performance (~50 TOPS) in devices starting under ~$800–$1,000. ([Best Buy][5])
* **Ecosystem & integration:** Apple’s Neural Engine delivers excellent efficiency and a rich software ecosystem, albeit with slightly lower TOPS and closed platform constraints. ([GEEKOM España][3])
* **Mid-range choice:** Intel’s Core Ultra provides balanced performance but generally trails Qualcomm/AMD in pure NPU throughput at similar price points. ([GEEKOM España][3])

If you want **specific benchmark numbers** (Geekbench AI, MLPerf, etc.) or a **real-world workload comparison (e.g., LLM inference / vision tasks)** across these NPUs, I can compile detailed tables for those too.
